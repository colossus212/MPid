Description
===========

A light-weight, fast PID library designed for use
on embedded systems (but can also run on any machine which has
a G++ compiler).

Can use either fixed-points (recommended for high-speed operation) or doubles 
(recommended for non-time critical algorithms).

Internal Dependencies:
======================
	
- UnitTest++ (test/UnitTest++). Lightweight C++ library for unit testing.
		
External Dependencies
=====================

- FixedPoint library. Required if you want to use fixed-point number types with the PID control loops.

Usage
=====

::

	PidDbl pidTest;
	
	
See test/PidTest.cpp for more examples.
	
Issues
======

For known bugs, desired enhancements e.t.c, see BitBucket issues section.
